1. Connect device via USB and make sure debugging is working.
2. `adb tcpip 5555`
3. `adb connect <DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS>:5555`
4. Disconnect USB and proceed with wireless debugging.
5. `adb -s <DEVICE_IP_ADDRESS>:5555` usb to switch back when done.

No root required!

To find the IP address of the device: run `./adb shell` and then `netcfg`.
You'll see it there.

@Sergei suggested that line 2 should be modified, commenting: "-d option
needed to connect to usb device when other connection persists (for
example emulator connected or other wifi device)".
