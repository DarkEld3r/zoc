The battlefield is divided up into tiles and important information
about the various terrain features (forests, village buildings, muddy
areas etc) represented on the map can be accessed by moving the game
cursor over each square.

Terrain features that are not within sight of
any of your units are depicted in grey. 

You can use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the
map and you can survey
the map by moving the
cursor to the appropriate
map edge.

Buildings, forests and hills can
block the line of sight of units
and enemy units in grey areas of
the map cannot be seen by you.

Smoke artillery – gives smoke cover for two or three turns
enabling your units to advance more safely towards enemy
positions. Smoke will block line of sight.

When the artillery symbol has “Ready” showing, left click on it
and a pink grid 7x7 squares large will appear. Move the grid to your
desired target area and left click again and an “Order artillery”
icon will appear. Left-click for the third time to order your artillery
barrage that will take place two turns later.

To move a unit you left-click on it. The tile that the unit is in is
highlighted by a green rectangle.
A small pop-up shows you the unit type, terrain type and the
cover given by the terrain, expressed as a percentage. All the tiles
that the unit may move into are
highlighted in green.

You also have the option
to order your unit to “Hold
Fire”, which will allow it to
remain hidden, if in terrain,
and ambush enemy units.

Infantry and self-propelled artillery units also have the capability
to use “Smoke” to hide their position from the enemy on a limited
number of occasions during a scenario.

You may set your units to “Hold Fire” if you do not want them
to engage the enemy. This may be important if you are planning
an ambush and you have moved your units into position without
being spotted by the enemy. Once your unit starts firing then it
is likely to be spotted by the enemy fairly quickly. Remaining
concealed and holding your fire until the enemy is in close range
is a very effective way of maximising the damage inflicted on
them. Any shots not used in your turn are saved to be used in
your opponents turn.

All units have the capability to use
“reaction fire” if an enemy moves
into their “line of sight”. Some units
are better at this than others because
of such attributes as poor viewing
devices, fixed guns and slow turrets. A unit will always have
one reaction shot, but if they have not fired in the previous turn
then they will able to fire all of
their shots. It is important to
remember that units are always
better at reacting to units that are
in front of them rather than at
their side or behind them.

5.2 Morale
Every time a unit is shot at by the enemy its morale will drop. When
the morale of a unit drops below 50 it will become “suppressed” 
and will not be able to fire at the enemy. When the morale of a unit
drops to 0, it will surrender if it is then shot at by an enemy in an
adjacent tile. Should the morale of a unit drop to – 100, then it will
permanently rout from the battle.
Morale will recover if a unit can go through a complete turn
without suffering further morale loss. So it can be judicious to
move “suppressed” units out of the front line in order to give them
time to recover.

Terrain is a very important consideration in Battle Academy 2.
Open ground is best for tanks and those units that need to move
quickly but it affords very little cover for infantry units moving on
foot. On the other hand, forests, buildings and fortifications give
very good cover to infantry units but are impassable to all vehicles.
Vehicles may enter terrain such as high vegetation, rough ground
and marshes to avail themselves of the extra cover these provide
but they will suffer movement penalties in the process.

Infantry units that come under enemy fire when moving will
immediately stop and may be stranded in the open as a result.

Units which come under fire will have their morale eroded. If
morale drops below 50, then units will not react to nor be able to fire
at the enemy. Suppressing the enemy can be vital before advancing
across open ground. Note that armour will still react to being
attacked, even when suppressed, but with large penalties to accuracy.
If you use suppression fire intelligently you can prevent enemy
units from recovering their morale.
